                There are two ways you can sign in to access Government of Canada
                online services. You can choose to sign in with a GCKey or with
                a Sign-In Partner. Both of these options allow you to access
                multiple Government of Canada services.

                <dd>
                    This is a simple way for anyone to access online services.
                    You create a GCKey username and password.

                    Sign in through your Canadian bank.  To use this method, you
                    must have an online bank account with one of the Sign-In
                    Partners.
